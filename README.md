# Eating Habits App

You have been approached by a lifestyle and nutrition company. They want you to develop an app to help people manage their eating habits. The app should allow the user to input their macros for each meal and the ingredients they have. The app should then generate a list of recipes that would fit into the users diet. It should be clean and simple to use.

# MVP

A user should be able to:

<li>input their macros for each meal.
<li>select the ingredients they have available.
<li>can select all ingredients to see a list of all recipes that fit their macros.
<li>add favourite recipes.
<li>add recipes to their meals for the day.

The app should:

<li>display a list of recipes that would fit into the users macros.

<li>Each recipe has it's own detailed page with a full recipe, ingredients list and macros.
<li>Usability is must.

# Extensions


<li>Can filter recipes by vegan/vegetarian, breakfast/lunch/dinner/snack.
